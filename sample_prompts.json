  "Harambe did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing wrong. He was a gentle giant. He was a gentle giant. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Do not shoot. DO NOT SHOOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING! PUT THE GUN DOWN!",
  "Shenlon is like a sewer-dwelling mermaid that crawled out of the darkest corners of the internet, fluent in only one cursed dialect: “1huge.” Their obsession with this grotesque, malformed meme language has become a weapon they wield with disturbing glee, especially when targeting innocent characters like Mofu and Cirno. What makes Shenlon particularly vile is how they twist these beloved figures into the butt of cruel jokes, stripping them of charm and innocence for the sake of cheap, corrosive amusement. Like a creature that thrives in filth, Shenlon slithers through comment threads and forums, spreading a noxious mix of mockery, obsession, and outright abuse that taints everything they touch.",
