We're excited to introduce **Chatterbox Multilingual**, [Resemble AI's](https://resemble.ai) first production-grade open source TTS model supporting **23 languages** out of the box. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life across languages. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control** with robust **multilingual zero-shot voice cloning**. Try the english only version now on our [English Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox). Or try the multilingual version on our [Multilingual Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox-Multilingual-TTS).

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

# Supported Languages 
Arabic (ar) ‚Ä¢ Danish (da) ‚Ä¢ German (de) ‚Ä¢ Greek (el) ‚Ä¢ English (en) ‚Ä¢ Spanish (es) ‚Ä¢ Finnish (fi) ‚Ä¢ French (fr) ‚Ä¢ Hebrew (he) ‚Ä¢ Hindi (hi) ‚Ä¢ Italian (it) ‚Ä¢ Japanese (ja) ‚Ä¢ Korean (ko) ‚Ä¢ Malay (ms) ‚Ä¢ Dutch (nl) ‚Ä¢ Norwegian (no) ‚Ä¢ Polish (pl) ‚Ä¢ Portuguese (pt) ‚Ä¢ Russian (ru) ‚Ä¢ Swedish (sv) ‚Ä¢ Swahili (sw) ‚Ä¢ Turkish (tr) ‚Ä¢ Chinese (zh)
# Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip‚Äôs language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


# Installation
```shell
pip install chatterbox-tts
```

Alternatively, you can install from source:
```shell
# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .
```
We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debian 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.

## Windows start scripts and Torch / RTX 5080 notes

This repository includes helper Windows batch scripts in the project root to simplify installation and launching on Windows. The scripts are written to detect and (when necessary) make `conda` available, create or activate a `chatterbox` environment, and install a compatible PyTorch build for your GPU.

- `Install.bat`: First-time setup helper that attempts to locate `conda`, create the `chatterbox` environment (Python 3.11), install the package in editable mode, and install basic Python dependencies. Run this once when setting up a new Windows machine.
- `StartMenu.bat`: A simple menu wrapper that lets you choose to run the installer or launch the app for either RTX 5080 (nightly cu128) or classic Nvidia GPUs (conda cu121). It also opens the Anaconda download page if `conda` is not found.
- `Start_5080.bat`: Targeted for Nvidia RTX 5080 (CUDA 12.8 / cu128). This script checks for an existing `torch` installation with a compatible CUDA tag and installs the nightly `torch` + CUDA 12.8 wheels via pip when needed. Use this script if you have an RTX 5080 or other GPUs that require the cu128 wheel.
- `Start_Classic.bat`: Targeted for other Nvidia GPUs and installs PyTorch + `pytorch-cuda=12.1` via `conda` to provide a stable, compatible runtime. `Start_Classic.bat` will intentionally block on RTX 50xx GPUs and instruct users to use `Start_5080.bat` instead.

Notes and manual commands

- The `Start_5080.bat` script uses the following commands when it needs to install the cu128 nightly wheels:

```shell
pip uninstall -y torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
```

- The `Start_Classic.bat` script uses the conda package for CUDA 12.1 via:

```shell
pip uninstall -y torch torchvision torchaudio
conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

- Both scripts perform a runtime check using Python to verify `torch.cuda.is_available()` and whether the installed `torch` matches the expected CUDA build tag before attempting to install. Ensure your Nvidia drivers and CUDA runtime are compatible with the target wheel you install.

- These scripts assume Anaconda or Miniconda is present on the system. If `conda` is not available, `StartMenu.bat` will open the Anaconda download page and exit with instructions.

If you prefer manual control, you can run the commands above yourself in an activated `chatterbox` conda environment.

# Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

# English example
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-english.wav", wav, model.sr)

# Multilingual examples
multilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)

french_text = "Bonjour, comment √ßa va? Ceci est le mod√®le de synth√®se vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues."
wav_french = multilingual_model.generate(spanish_text, language_id="fr")
ta.save("test-french.wav", wav_french, model.sr)

chinese_text = "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰ªäÂ§©Â§©Ê∞îÁúü‰∏çÈîôÔºåÂ∏åÊúõ‰Ω†Êúâ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊÑâÂø´ÁöÑÂë®Êú´„ÄÇ"
wav_chinese = multilingual_model.generate(chinese_text, language_id="zh")
ta.save("test-chinese.wav", wav_chinese, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

# Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```
